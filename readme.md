# Ember Sniper

Ember is a fully a fully automated deployed Minecraft username sniping system with an integrated discord bot and async Python API. Previously this codebase was closed source, and Ember was used as part of the Ember Sniping Service, which is no longer in operation. Due to Mojang [removing the name history API](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/8969841895693-Username-History-API-Removal-FAQ-), this sniping system no longer works.

This is a re-upload of a private repo that has sensitive contents in older versions, which is why there is no version history.
